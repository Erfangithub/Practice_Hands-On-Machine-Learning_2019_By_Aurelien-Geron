## Practice_Hands-On-Machine-Learning_2019_By_Aurélien Géron

- #### This repository contains my code practice of the chapters I've studied regarding the book entitled "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" (Released September 2019) by Aurélien Géron.

## Installation
- ### Google Colaboratory:
  - #### All the notebooks can be run with google colaboratory. Some chapters (e.g. chapter 3) have dependencies (e.g. saved models) that need to be uploaded to the same directory as the notebooks on google colaboratory.

- ### Otherwise:
  - #### Python 3 and Jupyter notebook need to be installed to run the notebooks.
  - #### For Chapters 2-9, the Python libraries required are:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    
    #### These can be installed by running: pip install -r requirements_Chapters2-9.txt, in a terminal application.
  - #### For Chapters 10-16 other than the Python libraries listed above tensorflow (version >= 2.0 ) needs to be installed. I personally used google colaboratory for these chapters as it was more convenient.
## Download the data:
- #### Download the zip file associated with the repository. Unzip the file. You'll see a folder named "Practice_Hands-On-Machine-Learning_2019_By_Aurelien-Geron-master" .
- #### If using Jupyter notebook change directory into this folder via a terminal application, launch Jupyter notebook and run the notebooks.
- #### If using google Colaboratory upload each notebook and its dependencies into google Colaboratory and run the notebooks (e.g. The folder associated to each chapter can be first uploaded to google drive and then uploaded to google Colaboratory via google drive.).
