## Practice_Hands-On-Machine-Learning_2019_By_Aurélien Géron

- #### This repository contains my code practice of the chapters I've studied regarding the book entitled "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" (Released September 2019) by Aurélien Géron.

## Installation
- #### Python 3 and Jupyter notebook need to be installed to run the notebooks.
- #### For Chapters 2-9, the Python libraries required are:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
    
  #### These can be installed by running: pip install -r requirements_Chapters2-9.txt, in a terminal application. 
 - #### For Chapters 10-16 other than the Python libraries listed above tensorflow (version >= 2.0 ) needs to be installed. I personally used google colaboratory for these chapters as it was more convenient.
## Download the data:
- #### Download the zip file associated with the repository. Unzip the file. You'll see a folder named "Practice_Hands-On-Machine-Learning_2019_By_Aurelien-Geron-master".
- #### If using Jupyter notebook change directory into this folder via a terminal application, launch Jupyter notebook and run the notebooks.
- #### If using google Colaboratory upload each notebook and its dependencies into google Colaboratory and run the notebooks. For example the folder named "Practice_Hands-On-Machine-Learning_2019_By_Aurelien-Geron-master" can be uploaded in google drive. After opening a notebook corresponding to a chapter, open a new cell at the beginning of the notebook file and mount google drive in colab. Now there is access to google drive via colab therefore change directory into "Practice_Hands-On-Machine-Learning_2019_By_Aurelien-Geron-master" and the corresponding chapter and run the notebook.
- #### Notebooks of chapters 2-9 do not need tensorflow and some of them (e.g. chapter 3 notebooks) have dependencies, therefore it is easier to run these in Jupyter notebook. Chapters 10-16 use tensorflow and have no dependencies therefore it is easier to run the notebooks corresponding to these chapters in google colab if tensorflow installation is not possible for some reason.
